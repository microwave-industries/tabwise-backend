# Object Specifications for our MongoDB Database

## Overview

The DB stores Room objects, which are created and/or joined. Each Room corresponds to the splitting of one receipt. That is to say, if you're at a restaurant and are splitting a receipt with friends, someone will upload a receipt, preprocessing etc is done, and a Room is created. Friends then join this Room.

The Room contains a list of Users and a list of ReceiptItems , among other fields.

The documentation below clarifies the objects.
